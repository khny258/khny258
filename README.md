### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kenny!

Full Stack Developer leveraging my 10+ years of experience in the finance industry to build useful applications and exciting things that will directly impact and change lives. After several years in Finance, I realized I had a love for coding so I enrolled in Columbia University where I became proficient in JavaScript, CSS, responsive web design, APIs, MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and MySQL. I can develop innovative applications such as a group project called Edward, a smarter version of the SECâ€™s EDGAR system, made with React, Puppeteer/Cheerio for scraping data, and React-VIS for charting data. My technical skills combined with my experience in collaborative, deadline-driven environments make me a strong addition to any web development team.
